Code Relating to my computer hobbies.


## Arduino101 RC Cars
The code meant for an Intel Arduino101 driving an RC car.
The code works, the instructables is rough drafted and not finished.

## IP Address Scanner
The code meant to scan the IP Addresses assigned to computers on the network.  It uses async parallelism and runs on both Windows and Linux.


## Intel Edison pushing bluetooth audio
The code meant for an Intel Edison that pushes Ogg Vorbis files to the car 
stereo in my car.  The write up and HW instructions maybe found at:
[Intel Edison pushing bluetooth audio](http://www.instructables.com/id/Intel-Edison-pushing-bluetooth-audio/](instructables))


## Setup Computer Variables
The code I use to setup a computer after I have restored its harddrive 
image.  The code currently contains hard coded dependencies that are 
common on my network.  These hard coded dependencies may not work in your
network simply because of missing files.
I have put NO instructions on the internet because this is resume fodder.


## VideoSyncServerAndClient
The code I wrote that automates serving videos between multiple client computers.  
I have put NO instructions on the internet because this is resume fodder.


## Weather Advisory Project
The code meant for an Intel Edison that wgets weather station web pages
and displays key information on the RGB LCD of a Grove Starter Kit.
The write up and HW instructions maybe found at:
[Intel Edison Weather Advisory Sketch](http://www.instructables.com/id/Intel-Edison-Weather-Advisory-Sketch/)


## timer
The Perl code meant to create a count down timer.  I use it for cooking.
This runs on Windows and requires Strawberry Perl and some PerlTK 
libraries.
I have put NO instructions on the internet because this is resume fodder.
